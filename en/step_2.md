## Scrolling text

Let's start by scrolling some text instructions on your micro:bit.



+ Go to <a href="https://rpf.io/microbit-new" target="_blank">rpf.io/microbit-new</a> to start a new project in the MakeCode (PXT) editor. Call your new project 'Fortune Teller'.

You can delete the `forever` block by dragging it over the palette, you don't need it for this project.

+ Drag a `show string` block inside your `start` block.

+ Test out your code. You can test it out in the emulator or on the micro:bit itself.
