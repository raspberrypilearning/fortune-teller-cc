## Introduction

You are going to code your micro:bit to read the future! Simply ask the micro:bit a question, and press a button to find out the answer!

__Instructions__: If you're reading this online, ask the micro:bit below a question and press __A__ to get your answer!

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of selection, by making a 'fortune teller'. The fortune teller will work like a magic 8-ball, and will give the user the answer to a question they ask the micro:bit.

## Resources
For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:18828-96734-17356-00995](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:18828-96734-17356-00995), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ FortuneTeller.hex

## Learning Objectives
+ Selection `if` blocks;
+ The `random` block.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Multiple answers" - Consolidating use of `if` blocks, by adding 'No' and 'Ask again' answers.
+ "Shake your micro:bit" - Shake the micro:bit instead of pressing a button.
